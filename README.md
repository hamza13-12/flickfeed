## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd flickfeed
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

- [ ] Implement `get_likes_count` method

### Serializers
- [ ] Complete serializer create/update methods to handle nested relationships
- [ ] Add validation to prevent duplicate reviews/likes

### Views

## üìà Extension Ideas

Once you've completed the basic tasks, consider these extensions:

1. Add search functionality with Django filters
2. Implement user recommendations based on viewing/rating history
3. Add JWT token blacklisting for better security
4. Implement a rate-limiting system for API requests
5. Create a proper API documentation using Swagger or ReDoc
